# Title: The earth is warming. What can we do as RSEs?

## Abstract (250 words max)

The Earth is getting warmer, and human activity is largely to blame. But what can we, as RSEs, do?

In this panel we will hear from people who are aligning their RSE work with our fight against climate change. This work can take a variety of forms: from monitoring and reducing the environment impact of high performance computing and data centre processing, through collaborating with research projects that mitigate the effects of climate change, to supporting advocates for climate action.

In addition to hearing about current climate-related projects that are underway, we aim to discuss the barriers in taking action, and the particular role that leaders in RSE can play. We hope that attendees will feel inspired to take action, enabled to find out more, and that as a community we can start to have this important conversation about something which will affect us all.


**Expertise level:** Novice

**Audience:** The target audience is broad as this topic is independent of any particular technology, job role, or career stage.

**Ensuring panel diversity:**

Myself (Lucy) and David both work in fields which suffer from lack of diversity. As such, we will look for speakers beyond our personal networks - using mailing lists and social media to ask for contacts-of-contacts, and contacting organisations specifically aimed at under-represented groups. We recognise that this process will take a longer time, and so will start the search for speakers as early as possible. We will invite people from under-represented groups first, and we will use video conferencing technology - which will hopefully be available (?) - to enable those unable to travel (due to disability or caring responsibilities, for example) to participate. We will encourage invited panel members to make use of the conference mentorship scheme and will offer our own support in addition to this (for example, meetings to discuss key ideas or topics that might be discussed).
